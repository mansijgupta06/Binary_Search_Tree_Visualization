Visual Binary Search with Vite and p5.


Hey there! This project is all about making binary search easy to understand. Binary search is a way to find stuff quickly in a sorted list. With this project, you can see how it works visually. You can add, remove, and look for things in the list, and see it happen!

Cool Stuff:
- **Easy to Use**: You can watch the search step by step, and it's super easy to understand.
- **Play Around**: You can change things like what's in the list and what you're looking for, and see what happens.
- **Learn Something New**: Whether you're just starting out or you already know a lot, this project can help you learn more about binary search.
